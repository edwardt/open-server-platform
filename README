Open Server Platform (OSP) is an open source (MIT License) project to make it easier to create secure, 
multi-threaded servers that can be distributed (onto the cloud even). You can find more information 
about OSP at http://www.openserverplatform.com. The main repository is on Google Code, but since SVN
 is such a nightmare to use, the bleeding edge code will be kept here, and push to Google every time 
something big happens.

For installation and usage instructions, please see the OSP-ADMIN file.
